This folder contains code for training and testing the LSTM model at a single column scale, a regional scale, and a national scale. The code for the single column model is in a Jupyter notebook (sc_lstm.ipynb), while the code for the regional and national models are scripts (regional_lstm.py and national_lstm.py). The scripts for the regional and national models share multiple functions for managing data and training the LSTM model, described in the _data.py and _lstm.py files. Obtaining data for the LSTM requires a HydroData account (see https://hf-hydrodata.readthedocs.io for details). Testing data for each of the models is included as text files for the regional and national models.
